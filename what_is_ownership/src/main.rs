//refernece and borrowing 
//so here we are using & to make a reference to the value of s1
// so first what happen is that the value beig used in calsulate_length is not moved
// because its using refenrence from the s1 value
// so the value of s1 is not moved and the value of s1 is still valid after the function is done

//The &s1 syntax lets us create a reference that refers to the value of s1 but does not own it. 
//Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.

    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, it is not dropped.

//Mutable References
//here is an example but it will not work because we are trying to change the value of s1
//here the value of s1 is immutable so we cannot change it
// fn test5() {
//     let s = String::from("hello");

//     change(&s);
// }

// fn change(some_string: &String) {
//     some_string.push_str(", world");
// }

//here is the solution if we want to change the value of s1
//so here we are using &mut s1 to make it mutable
fn test5() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

//there is restriction on the number of mutable references to a particular piece of data in a particular scope
//for example 
// let mut s = String::from("hello");

// let r1 = &mut s;
// let r2 = &mut s;

// println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
//This will not be able to work because the value of s is mutable and we are trying to use it twice

//so here is the solution
//so what it did here is that inside the curly braces is a new scope
//so when r1 goes out of scope it will be dropped and then we can use r2
fn test6() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
}

//here is also 1 more of bad example of using mutable reference
// let mut s = String::from("hello");

// let r1 = &s; // no problem
// let r2 = &s; // no problem
// let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

// println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
//this will not work because we are trying to use the value of s as mutable and immutable at the same time
//because s is referenced as immutable and mutable at the same time

//so here is the solution
//so in this case the value of r1 and r2 is no longer being used to now r3 can have &mut s without any problem.
fn test7() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);

}

//Dangling References
// so here is an example of dangling references
//so here the value of s is being returned but then the value of s is dropped
//so the value of s is dropped but then the value of s is still being used
//so this will not work
// fn test8() {
//     let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
// }

// fn dangle() -> &String {
//     let s = String::from("hello");

//     &s
// }

//here is also 1 other mistake people usually does
// fn test8() {
//     let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
// }

// fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

//     let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

//     &s // we return a reference to the String, s
// } // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
//   // Danger!

//so the best solution for this is to just return string immediately
fn test8() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    s 
}

//so there are times we need to use refernece or clone. But there are times to better just return the value immediately without reference or clone.

//Slicing 
//This function is to retunr the length of the first word in a string
fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
    //Because we need to go through the String element by element and check whether a value is a space, weâ€™ll convert our String to an array of bytes using the as_bytes method.
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    //Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the iter method:
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}

//so in this function u can see that we are using &String as a parameter but since word and s is not correlated in the first place so we can clear the value of s
fn test9() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5

    s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
